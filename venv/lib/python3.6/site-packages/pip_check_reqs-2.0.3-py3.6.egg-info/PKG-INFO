Description: pip-check-reqs
        ==============
        
        It happens: you start using a module in your project and it works and you
        don't realise that it's only being included in your `virtualenv`_ because
        it's a dependency of a package you're using. pip-missing-reqs finds those
        modules so you can include them in the `requirements.txt`_ for the project.
        
        Alternatively, you have a long-running project that has some packages in
        requirements.txt that are no longer actively used in the codebase. The
        pip-extra-reqs tool will find those modules so you can remove them.
        
        .. _`virtualenv`: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
        .. _`requirements.txt`: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#requirements-files
        
        Assuming your project follows a layout like the suggested `sample project`_::
        
            setup.py
            setup.cfg
            requirements.txt
            sample/__init__.py
            sample/sample.py
            sample/tests/test_sample.py
        
        .. _`sample project`: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#creating-your-own-project
        
        Basic usage, running in your project directory::
        
            <activate virtualenv for your project>
            pip-missing-reqs --ignore-file=sample/tests/* sample
            pip-extra-reqs --ignore-file=sample/tests/* sample
        
        This will find all imports in the code in "sample" and check that the
        packages those modules belong to are in the requirements.txt file.
        
        Additionally it is possible to check that there are no dependencies in
        requirements.txt that are then unused in the project::
        
            <activate virtualenv for your project>
            pip-extra-reqs --ignore-file=sample/tests/* sample
        
        This would find anything that is listed in requirements.txt but that is not
        imported by sample.
        
        Sample tox.ini configuration
        ----------------------------
        
        To make your life easier, copy something like this into your tox.ini::
        
            [testenv:pip-check-reqs]
            deps=-rrequirements.txt
            commands=
                pip-missing-reqs --ignore-file=sample/tests/* sample
                pip-extra-reqs --ignore-file=sample/tests/* sample
        
        
        Excluding test files (or others) from this check
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        Your test files will sometimes be present in the same directory as your
        application source ("sample" in the above examples). The requirements for
        those tests generally should not be in the requirements.txt file, and you
        don't want this tool to generate false hits for those.
        
        You may exclude those test files from your check using the `--ignore-file`
        option (shorthand is `-f`). Multiple instances of the option are allowed.
        
        
        Excluding modules from the check
        --------------------------------
        
        If your project has modules which are conditionally imported, or requirements
        which are conditionally included, you may exclude certain modules from the
        check by name (or glob pattern) using `--ignore-module` (shorthand is `-m`)::
        
            # ignore the module spam
            pip-missing-reqs --ignore-module=spam sample
            # ignore the whole package spam as well
            pip-missing-reqs --ignore-module=spam --ignore-module=spam.* sample
